			<p>This is the Android app for the website <a href="https://rsw.me.uk/blueline/" class="external">rsw.me.uk/blueline</a>. You're running version&nbsp;<script>document.write(Android.versionName());</script>.</p>
			<p>The app works offline and integrates into the Android OS in various ways not possible with the web-based app, although there is much re-use of code between the two.</p>
			<p>The source code is <a href="https://github.com/bobwallis/BluelineAndroid" class="external">made available</a> for interested people. Feedback is welcome.</p>
			<h3>Database</h3>
			<p>Method data is taken from the Central Council method collections maintained by Tony Smith. Database updates are not automatic, and this version of the app includes information published in The Ringing World up to and including the issue dated 14<sup>th</sup> July 2017.</p>
			<p>Calls are not part of the Central Council data, and are either manually set by me based on common practice, or guessed. In general:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Even-bell methods with 1 hunt bell and a <span class="notation">12</span> lead end are given <span class="notation">14</span> Bobs and <span class="notation">1234</span> Singles.</li>
				<li>Even-bell methods with 1 hunt bell and a <span class="notation">1n</span> lead end are given <span class="notation">1(n-2)</span>Bobs and <span class="notation">1(n-2)(n-1)n</span> Singles unless they are on Major or above and have a lead head code of M, in which case they are treated the same as those with a <span class="notation">12</span> lead end.</li>
				<li>Methods with 2 hunt bells are given Grandsire Bobs and Singles if they have a <span class="notation">1</span> lead end followed by a <span class="notation">3</span> or <span class="notation">n</span> for the first change of the lead.</li>
				<li>Calls are not guessed for Differentials, Minimus methods and principles.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Always check with the conductor if unsure.</p>
