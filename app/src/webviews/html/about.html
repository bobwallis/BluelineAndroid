			<p>This is the Android app for the website <a href="https://rsw.me.uk/blueline/" class="external">rsw.me.uk/blueline</a>. You're running version&nbsp;<script>document.write(Android.versionName());</script>.</p>
			<p>The app works fully offline and integrates into the Android OS in various ways not possible with the web-based app, although there is much re-use of code between the two.</p>
			<p>The source code is <a href="https://github.com/bobwallis/BluelineAndroid" class="external">made available</a> for interested people.</p>
			<h3>Usage</h3>
			<p>Find a method by typing its name into the search box, then tap the name to load full details, a copy of the method diagram, and a practice interface allowing you to tap through the blue line on screen.</p>
			<p>Tap on the tabs to select them, or swipe the screen left and right.</p>
			<h3>Settings</h3>
			<p>Access the Settings interface via the navigation drawer, or from the overflow menu in the method view. Sensible defaults are chosen for you based on your device size, but you are free to tweak to your preference.</p>
			<h3>Database</h3>
			<p>Method data is taken from the Central Council method collections maintained by Tony Smith. Database updates currently only take place when the app itself is updated. A future update may add a feature to allow updates to the database without a full application update.</p>
			<p>Calls are not part of the Central Council data, and are either manually set by me based on common practice, or guessed. In general:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Even-bell methods with 1 hunt bell and a 12 lead end are given 14 Bobs and 1234 Singles.</li>
				<li>Even-bell methods with 1 hunt bell and a 1n lead end are given 1(n-2) Bobs and 1(n-2)(n-1)n Singles unless they are on Major or above and have a lead head code of M, in which case they are treated the same as those with a 12 lead end.</li>
				<li>Methods with 2 hunt bells are given Grandsire Bobs and Singles if they have a 1 lead end followed by a 3 or n for the first change of the lead.</li>
				<li>Calls are not guessed for Differentials, Minimus methods and principles.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Always check with the conductor if unsure.</p>
