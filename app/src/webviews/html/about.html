			<p>This is the Android app for the website <a href="https://rsw.me.uk/blueline/" class="external">rsw.me.uk/blueline</a>.</p>
			<p>The source code is <a href="https://github.com/bobwallis/BluelineAndroid" class="external">made available</a> for interested people.</p>
			<h3>Usage</h3>
			<p>Find a method by typing its name into the search box, then tap the name to load full details and a copy of the method diagram.</p>
			<p>Tap on tabs to select them, or swipe the screen left and right.</p>
			<p>The 'practice' interface allows you to run through a method's blue line by tapping on the screen, and scores your performance by counting errors.</p>
			<h3>Settings</h3>
			<p>Access the Settings interface via the navigation drawer, or from the overflow menu in the method view.</p>
			<h3>Database</h3>
			<p>All data used to run the application is stored on your device, and the app works without an internet connection.</p>
			<p>Database updates currently only take place when the app itself is updated. A future update may add a feature to allow updates to the database without a full application update.</p>
