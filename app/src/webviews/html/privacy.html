			<h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
			<p>This app includes the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/" class="external">Google Firebase</a> service, and previously requested access to a limited amount of personal data to investigate the causes of crashes.</p>
			<p>The personal data collected was a pseudonymous "app-instance identifier" used to identify a unique installation of the app with which to associate other data such as your operating system version, screen size, and device specifications.</p>
			<p>The current version of the app (which you are using) no longer includes this part of the Firebase service, and no longer requests internet access from your device.</p>
			<p>All data used by the app is stored only on your device and isn't transmitted anywhere, to anyone, at any point.</p>
